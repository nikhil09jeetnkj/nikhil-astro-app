# NikhilAstro — PWA Starter (Next.js)

This is a minimal, styled Progressive Web App starter for an astrology app you can deploy to Vercel.
It stores profiles locally (localStorage) and shows a mock chart. Use it as the foundation and I will help plug real calculations later.

## Quick deploy to Vercel (from your phone)
1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a new repository and upload these files (you can upload the zip to GitHub via mobile browser).
3. Sign in to https://vercel.com with GitHub and import your repo. Vercel will build and deploy automatically.
4. Open the deployed URL in Safari on your iPhone → Share → Add to Home Screen.

## Local testing (optional)
- You need Node.js + npm and a computer to run locally:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open http://localhost:3000
